Saving out two versions of the same image in PhotoShop is an annoying chore that makes developers less productive so a computer should do it instead! ios-resize can also automatically create all icon files needed for every iOS app from a source file.\r\n\r\nios-resize will work for PNG files using Apple's naming convention (@2x) as well as the cocos2d framework naming conventions (-hd and -ipadhd). ios-resize defaults to resizing PNG files in a single directory but can be flagged to recursively look through all children directories as well. Please refer to the Usage and Installation sections for more information.\r\n\r\nImage resizing is done using PHP's image processing library.\r\n\r\nios-resize was developed for the Mac OS X 10.8 operating system since most iOS development happens on a Mac and PHP comes preinstalled on every Mac.\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n\r\nIn the Terminal, run:\r\n \r\n`ios-resize *`\r\n\r\nThis will resize all images in the current folder.\r\n\r\n`ios-resize file@2x.png file2@2x.png`\r\n\r\nThis will resize the two images specified.\r\n\r\n`ios-resize * -d`\r\n\r\nThis will resize all images in the current directory as well as all children directory recursively. Using the -d option will always result in all acceptable PNG files in children directories being resized.\r\n\r\n#### Make Icons:\r\n\r\n`ios-resize [src file] - icon`\r\n\r\nios-resize can also automatically create the necessary iOS icons out of a source image. The source image should be square and at least as big as the largest icon size (114 x 114). \r\n \r\n### Installation\r\n \r\nMake sure your path to PHP is located at /usr/bin/php otherwise edit the first line to point to PHP. Save the file if you changed the path to PHP.\r\n\r\nIn the Terminal, go to where the ios-resize file is and run:\r\n\r\n`chmod 777 ios-resize`\r\n\r\nThen copy the file to your /usr/bin directory by running:\r\n\r\n`cp ./ios-resize /usr/bin/ios-resize`\r\n\r\nYou may get a permission error so instead do:\r\n\r\n`sudo cp ./ios-resize /usr/bin/ios-resize`\r\n\r\nAnd enter your password when prompted. This assumes your user account has proper permissions to write to the /usr/bin folder.\r\n \r\n### Alternate Installation\r\n\r\nMake sure your path to PHP is located at /usr/bin/php otherwise edit the first line to point to PHP. Save the file if you changed the path to PHP. And you're done. The only difference is that usage will look like this instead:\r\n\r\n`php ios-resize file@2x.png`\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nios-resize is built by Tommy Leung on top of work by Jonathan Ellis on his [blog](http://jona.than.biz/blog/generating-non-retina-images-automatically-for-ios/). Features not found in original implementation include:\r\n\r\n* cocos2d format support\r\n* recursively directory search\r\n* make iOS icons\r\n* usage instructions in command line\r\n* comments on how it works (if you care)\r\n\r\nI do not personally know Jonathan Ellis, I just found his code on Google and thought it was quite useful so I extended it.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThere's really no support but you tweet me [@iamsupertommy](http://twitter.com/iamsupertommy) or find me on Github @supertommy and I'll see if I can help you.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nios-resize is released under the MIT License."}
